Ansible Role: releases
======================

This role helps with configuring base content for a releases mirror, as well as pre-staging releases into the staging area `.pool` and then actually making the release happen.
The pre-staging are only ran when specifing the tag `prepare` and the release only happens when specifying the `release` tag.
